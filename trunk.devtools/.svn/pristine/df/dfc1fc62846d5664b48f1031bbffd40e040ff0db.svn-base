# Description:                                                                #

# This script enhances default "svn merge" command performance, by            #
# integrating svn with the graphical 3-way merging tool kdiff3.               #
#                                                                             #
# Example usage:                                                              #
#                                                                             #
# svn merge -c 50474 "http://svn/branches/mybranch" --diff3-cmd svnkd3merge   #
#                                                                             #
# This command will open kdiff3 merging tool for every file to be merged.     #
# Manual intervention is allowed to control how the merge is to be performed. #
# Once the resulting file is as expected, ^s will save the result, and ^q will#
# exit the tool, saving the merge result.                                     #
#                                                                             #
